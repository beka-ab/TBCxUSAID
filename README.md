# Project Styling

In this project, I've used advanced styling techniques to ensure a polished and interactive user interface. Here's an overview of the key styling components:

## Font Faces

I utilize custom font faces to enhance the typography and overall design:

- **Tbc-light**
- **Tbc-medium**
- **Tbc-bold**
- **Tbc-extrabold**

These fonts are applied to different elements throughout the website, ensuring a consistent and aesthetically pleasing look.

## Color Scheme

The color scheme is thoughtfully chosen to create a cohesive and visually appealing interface:

- **Background Color:** RGB(43, 43, 43)
- **Header Background:** RGB(26, 30, 31)
- **Courses Color:** RGB(22, 22, 22)
- **Text Color:** RGB(244, 244, 244)
- **Button Color:** #00aeef

These colors are used to establish a harmonious visual identity across the project.
The use of CSS variables ensures a consistent and easily adaptable design.

## Key Styling Components

### Header

The main header features a responsive design with a navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes. The menu icon smoothly transitions into a full-screen menu on smaller screens.

### Slider

A flexible slider component showcases engaging content, providing an interactive and dynamic user experience. Navigation buttons and dots offer easy navigation.

### Courses Section

The courses section is dynamically populated with data fetched from an external file. Each course card is created dynamically using template literals, allowing for easy updates and additions.

### FAQ Section

The FAQ section dynamically generates elements using template literals based on external data, providing a scalable and maintainable solution. The interface is responsive.

### Footer

The footer is well-organized, featuring logos, social links, and important company information. It creates a visually appealing conclusion to the webpage.

## Responsive Design

The project follows a mobile-first design approach, ensuring a seamless and optimized experience for users on various devices. The media query breakpoints are defined as follows:

- **Desktop (min-width: 780px):** Optimized layout for larger screens.
